# random-color-pic-generator
a stupid way to create a random color bot

the main idea is to generate random values in RGB channels.
set the image width and length as you like, then how many random values should be generated in each channel by setting the r, g and b.
the total files should be saved in the same directory of the file with name "0x??????.jpg", and the quantity should be r*g*b.
the full RGB covers 16,777,216â€¬ colors (that's a large amount) so be carefully while generating files.
